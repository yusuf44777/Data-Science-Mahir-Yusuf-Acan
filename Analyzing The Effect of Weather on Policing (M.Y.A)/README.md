# Descriptions :
    
 - You will practice fixing data types, handling missing values, and dropping columns and rows while learning about the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset.

 - You'll be analyzing a dataset of **traffic stops** in Rhode Island that was collected by the **Stanford Open Policing Project**.
    
 - You'll find the instructions and information that you need in Jupyter Notebook files. There are also two datasets provided that you will use.
    
 - There are four chapters (each contains different Data Analysis instructions) that you need to complete.
 
 - Some parts of the chapter third require Data Visualization codes. These parts can be completed after Data Visualization with Python lessons. 
    
 - Clone/Download these files and work on your local, then push your solutions (.ipynb files) up to your GitHub repository.
 
 # Need to Study :
 - Basic `Pandas`, `NumPy` and visualization (optional) libraries.
 - `.astype()`
 - `str.cat()`
 - `to_datetime()`
 - `.contains()`
 - `.resample()`
 - `.crosstab()`
 - `.map()`
 - `.pivot_table()`
    
 - ### Good luck!
